The code uses hand tracking to control the volume of the laptop by analyzing the distance between two fingers. It captures video from the laptop's camera, overlays a hand mesh, and calculates the distance between specific landmarks. The hand gesture is mapped to adjust the system volume in real-time, and a visual representation of the volume level is displayed on the screen. The application continuously updates the camera feed with hand tracking information and frames per second (FPS) display.
